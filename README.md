## Game Instructions:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
   
   * When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score. 

     * The game will hide this amount until you click a crystal.
     * When you do click one, updates your score counter.

   * You win if your total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * You lose if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever you win or lose.

     * When the game begins again, you should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, your score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The game will show the number of games you have won and lost. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
